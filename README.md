<h1> Film </h1>

 <p>
A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, 
is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving 
images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive 
continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. 
The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. <br><br>
A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; 
by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; 
by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these 
techniques and other visual effects.The word "cinema", short for cinematography, is often used to refer to the industry of 
films and filmmaking or to the art of filmmaking itself. The contemporary definition of 
feelings, beauty or atmosphere by the means of recorded or programmed moving images along 
with other sensory stimulations.Films were originally recorded onto plastic 
film through a photochemical process, and then shown through a movie projector onto a 
large screen. <br><br>
The adoption of CGI-based special effects led to the use of digital 
intermediates. Most contemporary films are now fully digital through the entire process of 
production, distribution, and exhibition from start to finish. Films recorded in a photochemical 
form traditionally included an analogous optical soundtrack, which is a graphic recording of the 
spoken words, music and other sounds that accompany the images. It runs along a portion of the 
film exclusively reserved for it and is not projected.

<h1> The Breakdown </h1>
<p>
Films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures. They reflect those cultures, 
and, in turn, affect them. Film is considered to be an important art form, a source of 
popular entertainment, and a powerful medium for educating or indoctrinating citizens. 
The visual basis of film gives it a universal power of communication. Some films have 
become popular worldwide attractions by using dubbing or subtitles to translate the dialog 
into the language of the viewer. Some have criticized the film industry's glorification of 
violence and its potentially negative treatment of women.<br><br>

The individual images that make up a film are called frames. During projection of traditional 
films, a rotating shutter causes intervals of darkness as each frame in turn is moved into 
position to be projected, but the viewer does not notice the interruptions because of an 
effect known as persistence of vision, whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction
of a second after the source has been removed. The perception of motion is due to a psychological 
effect called phi phenomenon.

<h1>Preceding technologies</h1>

<p>
Preceding film in origin by thousands of years, early plays and dances had elements common 
to film: scripts, sets, costumes, production, direction, actors, audiences, storyboards, 
and scores. Much terminology later used in film theory and criticism apply, such as mise en scene 
(roughly, the entire visual picture at any one time). Owing to the lack of any technology for 
doing so, the moving images and sounds could not be recorded for replaying as with film.<br><br>

The magic lantern, probably created by Christiaan Huygens in the 1650s, could be used to project 
animation, which was achieved by various types of mechanical slides. Typically, two glass slides, 
one with the stationary part of the picture and the other with the part that was to move, 
would be placed one on top of the other and projected together, then the moving slide would 
be hand-operated, either directly or by means of a lever or other mechanism. Chromotrope slides, 
which produced eye-dazzling displays of continuously cycling abstract geometrical patterns and 
colors, were operated by means of a small crank and pulley wheel that rotated a glass disc.
